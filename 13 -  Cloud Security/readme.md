# Cybersecurity Bootcamp - Module 13: Cloud Security

## My Cloud Security Project

Over the last week, I created a highly available web server for XCorp's Red Team to use for testing and training. My lead cloud administrator requested a network diagram to document and keep records of the cloud infrastructure I set up. To fulfill this, I used draw.io to create a detailed diagram of the entire cloud setup.

### Cloud Recap
After completing all the cloud activities, I ended up with:

- A total of two VMs running DVWA.
- Both VMs receiving traffic from my load balancer.

### My Goal
My goal for this assignment was to create a network diagram that shows the entire cloud setup, including the Ansible jump box and the Docker containers running on each VM. This diagram can be used as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my cloud architecture capabilities.

### Diagram Details
I used a free account at draw.io to diagram the entire cloud network that I set up.

My diagram includes the following components:

- Azure resource group
- Virtual network with IP address range
- Subnet range
- Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
- Security group blocking traffic
- Load balancer
- All four VMs that I launched
- Locations where Docker and Ansible are deployed
