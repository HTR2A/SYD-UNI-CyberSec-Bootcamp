# Module 19 Challenge

I recently started my role as a SOC analyst at Vandalay Industries, a company specializing in importing and exporting.
Vandalay Industries relies on Splunk for their security monitoring, and over the past few months, they have faced multiple security challenges affecting their online systems.
My primary responsibility is to create searches, develop custom reports, and set up alerts to enhance Vandalay's security monitoring and safeguard their infrastructure against future threats.
