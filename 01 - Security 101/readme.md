# Cybersecurity Bootcamp - Module 1: Security 101 Report

## Overview

In this module, we explored foundational cybersecurity concepts, with a focus on understanding current threat landscapes through prominent security reports. The goal was to gain exposure to the tools and knowledge security professionals need to stay updated and navigate complex cybersecurity scenarios effectively. Below, you'll find a summary of the insights gathered from three industry-leading security reports, focusing on major threats and incidents affecting sectors across the globe.

### Reports Reviewed
- **Akamai Security Year in Review (2020)**
- **CrowdStrike Global Threat Report (2021)**
- **Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report**

## Key Findings

### 1. Dominant Ransomware Threats

The **CrowdStrike Global Threat Report (2021)** highlighted that the **Maze** ransomware family was particularly impactful in targeting the healthcare sector in 2020. This strain of ransomware was known for encrypting files and using double-extortion techniques to pressure victims into paying ransoms.

### 2. Sectors Targeted by Ransomware

According to the **Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report**, the industry targeted with the highest number of ransomware-associated data extortion operations was **Educational Services**. This sector faced a surge in attacks largely due to remote learning vulnerabilities and increased use of digital platforms without adequate security.

### 3. Major Hacker Groups

The **CrowdStrike report** identified **WICKED PANDA** as a key hacker group involved in criminal activities from the **People's Republic of China**. This state-sponsored actor has been linked to numerous cyber espionage campaigns, primarily targeting telecommunications and government sectors.

### 4. Evolution of Ransomware Tactics

The first ransomware actor observed using data extortion in a campaign was **TWISTED SPIDER**, as noted in the **CrowdStrike Global Threat Report**. This group set the trend for data exfiltration and blackmail tactics that have since become common in ransomware operations.

### 5. Access Broker Activity

The concept of **Access Brokers** is discussed in the **Verizon report**. These are threat actors who gain back-end access to organisations and sell this access on criminal forums or through private channels. Their activity has fuelled the rise in sophisticated, multi-layered cyberattacks.

### 6. Credential-Based Attacks

**Akamai's Year in Review** reported on various strategies that attackers use to gain privileged access, such as **brute force**, **password spraying**, and **credential stuffing**. These attacks are increasing due to widespread password reuse and inadequate credential management practices.

### 7. Data Extortion Trends

**TWISTED SPIDER** is credited for popularising the heavy adoption of data extortion in ransomware campaigns. Their actions significantly influenced the tactics of other cybercriminal groups in 2020.

### 8. eCrime Activity Insights

According to **CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch**, **79%** of all intrusions in 2020 were classified as **eCrime** intrusions. This figure illustrates the growing prevalence of financially motivated attacks.

### 9. Most Reported Adversary

The **most reported criminal adversary of 2020** was **WIZARD SPIDER**, an eCrime group that became notorious for its high-tempo operations and ransomware campaigns targeting various sectors.

### 10. eCrime Ecosystem

**CrowdStrike** highlighted various parts of the **eCrime ecosystem**, including **infrastructure**, **monetisation**, **services**, and **distribution** channels that facilitate and sustain cybercriminal activities.

### 11. SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack

The **malicious code** used to exploit a vulnerability in the **SolarWinds Orion IT management software** was named **SUNBURST**. This attack, covered extensively in the **CrowdStrike report**, had far-reaching implications for the public and private sectors globally.

## Summary

The insights from these reports underline the importance of staying informed and vigilant in the rapidly changing field of cybersecurity. Key trends include the rise of data extortion, the targeting of vulnerable sectors such as healthcare and education, and the significant role of state-sponsored actors and sophisticated criminal ecosystems.

To mitigate these threats, organisations must focus on robust credential management, proactive threat hunting, and investing in technologies that enhance network visibility and response times.
