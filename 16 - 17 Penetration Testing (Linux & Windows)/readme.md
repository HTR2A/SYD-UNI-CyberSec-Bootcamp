# Assessment Objective
The primary goal of this assessment was to provide an analysis of security flaws present in Rekallâ€™s web applications, networks, and systems. 
This assessment was conducted to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities to provide a greater level of security for the environment.
I used my proven vulnerability testing methodology to assess all relevant web applications, networks, and systems in scope.
